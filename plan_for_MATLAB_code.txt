Problems:
Image callbacks are a pain

Same as C version for group selection and single images
	Local binary image keeps track of the points that are being currently selected
		Only relative to the current segment
	Points are relative to the entire space
		New points get added onto a long list
		False designations happen to the long list of "valid points"
	Logical indexing finds points in the current area
		As completed

Draw on image
	Points drawn on are colored white for the moment
	Determine if a single point click or circle drawn around points
		Point classifications change
	Mouse callbacks reset on the image

Tonight:
	Mouse callbacks setup on the original image
	Draw points to a binary image
		Perhaps try to determine if single point or circled points tomorrow
		Binary image will determine points tomorrow
		Save the binary image to file for now
	Keyboard presses signal segment is done
	Keyboard presses signal to switch between positive/negative

Ex:
	Setup mouse-callback to draw binary image
	Draw the binary image to file
	Reset the mouse callbacks to draw another binary image after the first click

	Everything else tomorrow

Keyboard calls signal:
	Change between images
